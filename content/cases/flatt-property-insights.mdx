# Flatt: Property Management & AI Insights

## The Challenge

Flatt faced a fragmented communication ecosystem where property owners, tenants, and contractors struggled with:

- **Scattered communications**: Messages spread across WhatsApp, email, and phone calls
- **No centralized system**: Property data and maintenance requests were lost
- **Manual rent collection**: Inconsistent payment tracking and late fees
- **Poor tenant experience**: Long response times for maintenance requests
- **No predictive insights**: Reactive rather than proactive property management

## The Solution

I built a comprehensive property management super-app with integrated AI capabilities:

### üè† Unified Property Dashboard
- **Centralized communication**: All stakeholders in one platform
- **Real-time notifications**: Instant updates for urgent issues
- **Document management**: Contracts, invoices, and maintenance records

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Insights

- **Maintenance prediction**: AI identifies potential issues before they occur
- **Tenant behavior analysis**: Patterns for better property management

### üí¨ Automated Tenant Support

- **Smart routing**: Complex issues automatically escalate to humans
- **Self-service portal**: Tenants can submit and track requests

## Technical Implementation
