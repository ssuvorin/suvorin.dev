# Instagram Mass Uploader: Automated Multi-Account Video Posting

## The Challenge

- **Manual Instagram video uploading is slow, risky, and hard to scale across accounts**
- **Managing proxies, 2FA, and anti-detection is complex**

## The Solution

A Python/Django system that:

- Integrates with Dolphin Anty browser and ruCAPTCHA
- Supports multi-account, proxy, and 2FA management
- Provides real-time web UI for monitoring and control

## Technical Implementation

- **Django**: Backend, API, and admin
- **Playwright**: Browser automation with human-like simulation
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive web UI
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database
- **pillow**: Video/image processing

## Results

- **3-5x faster uploads**
- **Multi-account and proxy support**
- **Advanced anti-detection and security**

## Key Features

- Mass video upload to Instagram
- Human-like automation (mouse, delays)
- Proxy, 2FA, and email verification
- Real-time web dashboard
- Detailed logs and statistics

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Django
- Playwright
- Bootstrap
- SQLite/PostgreSQL
- pillow
