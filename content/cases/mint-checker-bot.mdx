# Mint Checker: NFT Intel Bot 2.0

## The Challenge

NFT collectors and traders faced a critical information gap when evaluating new projects:

- **Slow research process**: Manual wallet analysis took 15-30 minutes per project
- **Information overload**: Raw blockchain data was overwhelming and hard to interpret
- **Missed opportunities**: By the time analysis was complete, good mints were sold out
- **Inconsistent evaluation**: Different collectors used varying criteria for assessment
- **No trend insights**: Historical data wasn't being leveraged for predictions

## The Solution

I built an intelligent Telegram bot that provides instant NFT project analysis:

### üîç Instant Wallet Analysis
- **Holder profiling**: Analyzes wallet composition and trading patterns
- **Whale detection**: Identifies influential collectors and their positions
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluates wallet diversity and investment patterns
- **Historical tracking**: Monitors wallet behavior over time

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Insights
- **Trend summarization**: GPT analyzes patterns and provides plain English insights
- **Risk scoring**: AI evaluates project viability based on multiple factors
- **Recommendation engine**: Suggests whether to mint based on wallet analysis
- **Market sentiment**: Analyzes social media and community signals

### ‚ö° Real-time Updates
