# Fuse Parsing Content: Telegram Content Moderation & Automation

## The Challenge

- **No unified system for parsing, moderating, and auto-posting Telegram content with AI and integrations**
- **Manual moderation and posting is slow and error-prone**

## The Solution

A Python system that:
- Parses and filters Telegram channel content asynchronously
- Moderates posts via Telegram bot with inline controls
- Integrates with Notion and Threads for content management
- Uses OpenAI for content analysis and improvement

## Technical Implementation

- **telethon/aiogram**: Telegram API and bot logic
- **sqlalchemy/asyncpg**: Database and async operations
- **aiohttp**: HTTP requests
- **openai**: AI content analysis
- **notion-client**: Notion API integration

## Results

- **Automated content flow from parsing to posting**
- **AI-powered moderation and improvement**
- **Multi-platform integration (Notion, Threads, Telegram)**

## Key Features

- Async channel parsing
- Inline moderation controls
- AI content analysis and improvement
- Notion/Threads integration
- Channel management and analytics

## Technology Stack

- Python
- telethon
- aiogram
- sqlalchemy
- aiohttp
- openai
