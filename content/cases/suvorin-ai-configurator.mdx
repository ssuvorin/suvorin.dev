# Suvorin.Mebel: AI Configurator

## The Challenge

Suvorin.Mebel, a custom furniture manufacturer, faced a significant barrier in the online sales process:

- **Visualization gap**: Clients couldn't see how custom furniture would look in their space
- **High abandonment rate**: 70% of leads dropped off before ordering
- **Manual rendering costs**: Each custom visualization required expensive 3D modeling
- **Long sales cycles**: Multiple back-and-forth iterations with clients
- **Limited customization options**: Static product images didn't show variations

## The Solution

I built an AI-powered furniture configurator that transforms the customer experience:

### ðŸŽ¨ AI-Powered Visualization
- **Text-to-3D rendering**: Stable Diffusion generates realistic furniture previews
- **Room context**: AI places furniture in realistic room settings
- **Material variations**: Shows different fabrics, woods, and finishes
- **Lighting adaptation**: Adjusts rendering based on room lighting conditions

### âš¡ Instant Customization
- **Real-time preview**: Changes appear instantly as customers adjust options
- **Interactive controls**: Sliders and buttons for dimensions, colors, materials
- **Smart suggestions**: AI recommends complementary pieces and styles
- **Price calculation**: Dynamic pricing updates with each customization

### ðŸ›’ Streamlined Checkout
- **One-click ordering**: Seamless transition from configuration to purchase
- **Secure payments**: Stripe integration for instant payment processing
- **Order management**: Automated order creation and tracking
- **Production integration**: Direct connection to manufacturing systems

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (Tilda)
- **No-code platform**: Rapid development and easy maintenance
- **Responsive design**: Works perfectly on all devices
