# Herbix: Vitamin Marketplace

## The Challenge

Herbix needed an alternative to iHerb for supplement sales, but their support team was overloaded by customer requests. Visitors required a seamless, automated experience to find and purchase the right vitamins, but manual support could not scale and led to lost sales.

## The Solution

We built an AI-powered marketplace with:
- **LLM-based dynamic pricing API** for real-time, personalized offers
- **Conversational chatbot** to guide users through product selection
- **Full e-commerce marketplace** for supplement sales

This solution automated the customer journey, reduced support load, and increased order value.

## Results

- 35% reduction in support load
- 18% increase in average order value

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** FlutterFlow
- **Backend:** Python, Firebase
- **AI:** OpenAI function-calling

The Herbix Vitamin Marketplace demonstrates how AI automation can transform e-commerce, making it scalable and user-friendly while driving business growth.
